# Car Rental Optimization Models Operations Research
This repository contains optimization models for solving the Car Rental problems described in "Model Building in Mathematical Programming" by H.P. Williams, specifically sections 12.25 (Car Rental 1) and 12.26 (Car Rental 2).

## Objectives
Excel Model: Spreadsheet model in Excel for the integrated Car Rental problem, with clear labels, comments, and annotations representing the algebraic model.

LP-Solve Model: Algebraic model implemented in LP-Solve format, with detailed comments aligning with the modelâ€™s constraints and objectives.

### Files Included

Excel Spreadsheet Model: Structured model for the Car Rental optimization, including calculations, constraints, and solver configurations.

LP-Solve Model: LP-Solve file implementing the algebraic model, with comments clarifying each constraint and objective.
